## INTRODUCTION
LinkScribe is a web application, where users can copy and paste a web link. The application will process it and extract the information obtained.

### 1. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK framework  🐙
Nowadays you can find an endless amount of web pages so it has become more difficult for each user to remember each of these, the lack of an efficient information system makes the processes become slower, wasteful and have to resort to manual methods, such as handmade lists.Although there are also applications to create lists, these are tied to a specific browser and does not allow free interaction between selected users.
